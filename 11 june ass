1.Pragya sells footballs. She has a large container to store footballs which is closed from below. Footballs are piled
one on top of the other in the box. When new balls are supplied, Pragya puts the balls in the box from the top. When a 
customer buys a ball, she delivers the ball at the top of the pile to the customer. Each ball has a code. She wants to 
store the ball codes in a data structure to keep track of her inventory. What data structure should she use?-->Stack

2.To fully specify a singly linked linked-list, which of the following options is necessarily required?-->Address of first element

3.A list is implemented as a singly linked link-list. The address of the first and last node are stored in variables first and last.
Given the address of a node is given in the variable node, the element stored in the node can be accessed by the statement node->data 
and the address to the next node can be accessed by node->next. Yusuf writes the code to delete the first element from the linked-list.
He writes the following function, where first and last are passed by reference.

function deleteElement(first, last)
{
      if (firstisequalnull)
      {
               print "List empty"
       }
       else
      {
                  first = first->next
         }
}

In which of the following scenarios will the code not work properly?--> It will work well in all possible cases.

4.For a binary search tree, which traversal will result in a sorted list?-->Inorder

5.For a binary tree with n nodes, what is the time complexity to search an element in it?-->O(log n)

6.We have a list of elements and we want to sort them using insertion sort. Which data structure among the
following should we use to store the elements to give low time-complexity of sorting on average?--> Linked List

7.Find the output of the program
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x;
	for(x=-1; x<=10; x++)
	{
		if(x < 5)
			continue;
		else
			break;
		printf("Alpingi");
	}
	return 0;
}-->0 times


8.Integer a = 20, b =10, c = 20, d =10
Print a*b/c-d
Print a*b/(c-d)
Will the output be same for the two ?-->The output will have a difference of 20

9.Usain Bolt runs 400 meters race, the timekeeper wants to write a program to save his track
timing what kind of a data type should he be using to store the temporary data?-->double

10.short s1 = 20;
short s2 = 400;
int a;
a = s1 * s2;-->A value 8000 will be assigned to a.

11.Output of following program?
#include<stdio.h>
 int main()
 {
     float x = 0.1;
     if ( x == 0.1 )
     printf("IF");
     else if (x == 0.1f)
      printf("ELSE IF");
      else
      printf("ELSE");
 }-->ELSE IF
 
 
 12.Paras has to write a code using a consecutive number of registers and these registers can 
 at max have 11 bits. How many signed numbers can he store in this-->2048
