1.Q is an empty queue. The following operations are done on it:

ADD 5

ADD 7

ADD 46

DELETE

ADD 13

DELETE

DELETE

ADD 10

What will be the content of Q after these operations? Front is marked by (F) and Rear is marked by (R).-->10(R) 13(F)


2.A is an empty stack. The following operations are done on it.

PUSH(1)

PUSH(2)

POP

PUSH(5)

PUSH(6)

POP

What will the stack contain after these operations?-->1 5


3.A pseudo-code is used. Assume that when two data-types are processed through an operator, the answer maintains the same data-type as the input data-types. 
Assume that all data-types have enough range to accommodate any number. If two different data-types are operated on, the result assumes the more expressive data-type.

What will be the output of the following pseudo-code statements?

Integer a = 456, b, c, d =10

b = a/d

c = a - b

print c-->411


4.What is implied by the argument of a function?--> The variables passed to it when it is called


5.In a sequential programming language, code statements are executed in which order?-->From top to bottom


6.Geeta takes as input 2 integer numbers, a and b, whose value can be between 0 and 31. She stores them as 5 bit numbers.
She writes the following code to process these numbers to produce a third number  c = 2*(a - b)
In how many minimum bits should Geeta store c?-->7 bits


7. Which of the following data structures may give overflow error, even though the current number of elements in it is less than
its size?-->Queue implemented in a linear array

8.Farhan writes a code to find the factorial of an inputted number. His code gives correct answers for some inputs and 
incorrect answers for others. What kind of error does his program have?-->Logical Error

9.As part of the maintenance work, you are entrusted with the work of rearranging the library books in a shelf in
proper order, at the end of each day. The ideal choice will be -->Insertion Sort

10.Ragu writes a program to find an element in the array A[5] with the following elements in order: 18 32 44 46 57. She runs the program to find a number X.
X is found in the first iteration of binary search. What is the value of X?-->44

11. A stack is implemented as a linear array A[0...N-1]. Farhan writes the following functions for pushing an element E into the stack.

function PUSH( top, E, N )
{
         if(XXX)
        {
             top= top+1
              A[top] = E
           }
           else
          {
                 print "Overflow"
            }
            return top
}

Fill in the condition XXX-->top< N-1


12.A queue is implemented by a linear array of size 10 (and not as a circularly connected array). Front and Rear are represented 
as an index in the array. To add an element, the rear index is incremented and the element is added. To delete an element, the front 
index is incremented. The following operations are done on an empty queue.

ADD 1; DELETE; ADD 2; ADD 3; ADD 4; DELETE, DELETE

After this set of operations, what is the maximum capacity of the queue?-->7
